## Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure as a Contributing Factor to COVID-19 Mortality in the United States

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the analysis from our paper "Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure as a Contributing Factor to COVID-19 Mortality in the United States."

### Code:

[`Processing.R`](https://github.com/lylla318/covid19-haps/blob/master/Processing.R) contains all code for pre-processing the data for the analysis. Users must download three additional datafiles and drop them in the `data` directory:

* [2014 NATA Respiratory Hazard Index by Source Group](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-08/nata2014v2_national_resphi_by_tract_srcgrp.xlsx)
* [2014 NATA Respiratory Hazard Index by Pollutant](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-08/nata2014v2_national_resphi_by_tract_poll.xlsx)
* [EPA Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool](ftp://newftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN/2019/EJSCREEN_2019_USPR.csv.zip)


[`Analysis.R`](https://github.com/lylla318/covid19-haps/blob/master/Analysis.R) contains the code to implement both single and multi-pollutant mixture models. 

[`Figures.R`](https://github.com/lylla318/covid19-haps/blob/master/Figures.R) contains code to reproduce the figures in the paper.

[`Tables.R`](https://github.com/lylla318/covid19-haps/blob/master/Tables.R) contains code to reproduce the tables in the paper.
